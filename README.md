# flexbox-introduction

Hello world, today is Day 6 since my learning began. 
After deciding a lot, I decided to take on the journey of the odin project. 
So far I have learned about GIT and it is so useful!

Today I will finally be moving onto flexbox after refining my skills in HTML and CSS.
I feel pretty confident with CSS as it is a very basic language compared to C++ (That's not even close)

Alright, its time to make a Git commit, see you tomorrow!
