There are 3 properties defined by flex.

flex is a shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis.
e.g. 
    div{
        flex: 0 1 0%;
    }

The first 0 is flex-grow
The 1 is flex-shrink and
0% is the flex basis and these are also the default values

we generally see flex be defined with one value e.g. flex: 1;
in that case we are actually declaring it as flex: 1 1 0%; 
as 1 is the default for flex-shrink and 0% is the default for flex basics.
